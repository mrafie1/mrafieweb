    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p class="padding1">I'm a Computer Science Specialist and Economics Major at the University of Toronto St. George.
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm currently learning front-end and back-end development, basics of ML (creating my own model!!!), and
      improving my statistics and data-science skills.
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm seeking internship opportunities where I can apply my programming and problem-solving skills
      to applications combining computer science, economics, and business.

    <h2>My Projects</h2>

    <h3>Top Hoops: <em>NBA Optimal Basketball Lineup</em></h3>
    <img src="src/project1.png" alt="Top Hoops Player Graph" title="Graph displaying the passes between
    players and the optimal lineup" width="597" height="452.2" loading="lazy">

    <p class="padding1">I developed the program Top Hoops for a CSC111 group project. The program requires the user to
    input a dataset of NBA players and their respective statistics. Then it outputs a heatmap of passes
    between players and a graph displaying the interactions between players, their 'teamwork strength', and
    the optimal 5-player lineup based on their statistics. <br>
    To learn more and try the program out, check out Top Hoops'

    <h3>SnapBack</h3>

    <img src="src/project2.png" alt="SnapBack Chatbot Page" title="Customers interacting with the
    customer service chatbot" width="495" height="725" loading="lazy">
    <p class="padding1">SnapBack was developed during the <abb title="Rotman Commerce FinTech Association">RCFTA</abb>
    Hack the Future Hackathon as application to improve the customer return process, reduce
    overall returned items for businesses, and reducing the environmental impact of returns.
      My group's product featured 24/7 customer service chat and automatic
    image detection for item returns: all powered with Google Gemini API.
